# Security Policy

## Overview

Hat is a powerful tool designed to provide secure file encryption and decryption directly within your browser. This project ensures that your sensitive data remains private by performing all encryption processes client-side, without the need for server interactions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in Hat, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Instead, send a detailed report to our security team at [security@v4nt.com](mailto:security@v4nt.com).
   
2. Include in your report:
    - A detailed description of the vulnerability
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
    - Any potential impact the vulnerability might have
    - Your contact information for follow-up

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 72 hours and provide a timeline for the fix. We ask that you give us at least 90 days to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.

## Security Best Practices

To ensure the highest level of security when using Hat, we recommend the following best practices:

- **Keep your browser up to date:** Ensure you are using the latest version of your web browser to benefit from the latest security patches.
- **Use strong passwords:** When encrypting files, choose strong, unique passwords to enhance security.
- **Regularly update dependencies:** Ensure that all third-party libraries and dependencies are up to date to avoid known vulnerabilities.

## Data Privacy

Hat performs all encryption and decryption processes client-side, meaning your data never leaves your browser. We do not store or transmit your data to any servers.
